    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we choose for this project was Super Resolution, but not the usual image super resolution, but video super resolution. The goal is to take a low resolution video, say 640x360 and create a higher resolution video, say 1280x720p from it with accuracy and image quality as high as possible and hopefully beating the common interpolation method. What the video part brings into the table is the fact that although video is just a sequence of images, consecutive frames usually share some similarities, and by looking at the previous and next frames we can try to predict the current frame with higher accuracy. The downside is increased computational time since we need to process multiple input images per one output frame, limitations in computational resources was the main problem we encountered. Since our solution makes use of information happening over time we will sometimes refer to it as temporal super resolution (TSR).\n"

    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the Inter4k video dataset, it consists of 1000 videos recorded in 4k at 60 fps. The videos are short, around 5s which amount to 300 frames per video and 300,000 frames in whole dataset. dataset of such size was absolutely infeasible for us to process in a reasonable time, so we decided to only use a part of it. Moreover to save computational resources we resized the videos to smaller resolutions, we experimented a bit with different resolutions before settling on 360p to 720p upscaling. Although our model is Fully Convolutional Neural Network which makes is agnostic on the image size, we assumed that by focusing on specific resolution we would get the best results, that's why all the results from now on refer to 360p->720p upscaling.\n"

    "## Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a simple 6 layer fully convolutional model, based on convolutional layers and ReLU functions, but the first crucial step is to upscale the input image to the desired resolution. Since we do not use convolutional layers to increase the size of an input image we rely on regular bicubic interpolation to bring image to the desired size the we use our stack of trainable layers to reconstruct high quality image from low quality interpolation upscaling result. This also makes bicubic interpolation an ideal baseline for comparisons. The convolutional layers do not get padding because we didn't want the padded zeroes to interfere with image reconstructing effort, this mean that the output image is actually couple of pixels smaller than expected although this could be remedied by upsampling the image to slightly higher base size. Our model can be initialized with number of past/future frames to use in upscaling and upscale_factor (ratio of output and input resolutions), the concatenation happens in forward function where we stack the input frames along the channel dimension. We tried working with models using 1 and 2 future/past frames but we didn't get result high enough to justify higher computational demand so we sticked to 1 past/future frame. We also created a bigger variant of the architecture with bigger kernels and more neurons for comparison, unfortunately its increased training time forced us to decrease the number of epochs to the detriment of final results and the result was clearly underfitted model. Altough we can imagine someone with more computational resources making good use of the this bigger model we abandoned it in favor of smaller one.\n"

This is not ideal since the model doesn't get to see the whole dataset at once, but it was the only way to make it work.

    "We wanted to test 3 optimizers AdamW, Adagrad, and SGD, and 3 loss functions MSE, PNSR, and DSSIM, additionally we wanted to test the larger version of the model, however due to the computational limitations we couldn't train each model on the whole data so we started with a smaller dataset of 36 videos (~10,000 frames) and uptrained only the models which got good results. In this first turn on 36 datasets and 10 epochs we trained in total 6 models:\n",

    "For each model we used 0.0001 learning rate as it is a popular choice and a single past and future frame. We tried using 2 frames but the results were not good enough to justify the increased computational demand. Each model was trained ans tested on 360->730p upscaling, because smaller image size allowed us to train the models faster. Batch size was set to 8 which was dictated by the VRAM capacity of the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training and inference times**\\\n",
    "Training of a single model in this configuration took around 2.5h this was also true for larger model trained with smaller number of epochs, and later when we training models on 108 videos with 3 epochs the time was also similar. Inference with smaller model takes around 50s per video, 6 frames per second, and with larger model around 75s per video, 4 frames per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Already in the training phase model trained with SGD optimizer gave results so poor that we resigned from training it on the two remaining losses. Adagrad's performance was similarly poor and we skipped training it on DSSIM loss. As mentioned before the large model was trained only for 3 epochs instead of 10 due to computational limitations which resulted in underfitting. After training we evaluated the models on 10 videos from the dataset (none of which were used in training) for each of them we calculate average values of metrics all frames, Since cubic interpolation is our baseline we also calculated the same metrics for it calculated the difference between the model metrics and cubic metrics. Additionally since having two separate metrics made it difficult to compare models we introduced an additional metric QM (Quality Measure) defined as: a geometric mean of PSNR and DSSIM.\n",

The reason we chose those resolutions is that 720p->1440p features the same upscaling factor as 360p->720p of x2, while 720p->1080p has a scaling factor of x1.5, and we wanted to find out whether that would influence the results.
